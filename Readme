# ðŸ§  Multi-Agent AI System using Google ADK

This project is a modular, multi-agent AI system that accepts a **user-defined goal**, breaks it into steps, routes data between API-based agents, and returns an **intelligent summary**. Built using Python, the system demonstrates **agent collaboration**, **goal planning**, and **data enrichment** using real-time public APIs.
