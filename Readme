# 🧠 Multi-Agent AI System using Google ADK

This project is a modular, multi-agent AI system that accepts a **user-defined goal**, breaks it into steps, routes data between API-based agents, and returns an **intelligent summary**. Built using Python, the system demonstrates **agent collaboration**, **goal planning**, and **data enrichment** using real-time public APIs.

## 🚀 Example Goal

## 🧩 Agents Overview

### 🔹 `Planner Agent`
Breaks down the user goal into actionable steps and determines execution order.

### 🔹 `SpaceX Agent`
Fetches the next SpaceX launch date, time, and location using the SpaceX public API.

### 🔹 `Weather Agent`
Retrieves weather conditions for the launch location using OpenWeatherMap API.

### 🔹 `Summary Agent`
Analyzes weather data and predicts whether the launch may be delayed.
